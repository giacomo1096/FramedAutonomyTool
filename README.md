# Planning Based Tool for Framed Autonomy
## Description
The tool implements an automata-based technique to achieve framed autonomy in AI-augmented Business Process Management Systems (ABPMSs). It combines procedural and declarative constraints through deterministic finite state automata (DFAs), guiding process continuations with minimal violation costs. This technique is powered by Automated Planning in Artificial Intelligence to recommend near-optimal process flows while respecting predefined boundaries.

## Hot to use the tool
The tool is known to work on Mac and Linux machines.
